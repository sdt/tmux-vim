# tmux-vim

`tmux-vim` is a bash script which works in conjunction with **tmux** to create a persistent **vim** pane within a **tmux** window.

## Requirements

You need **tmux** version 1.6 or later.

## Installation

Copy **tmux-vim** to somewhere in your path.

## Usage

Use **tmux-vim** just like you'd use **vim**.

`tmux-vim [file] [files...]`

The first time you run it, a new pane will be created on the right hand side of your **tmux** window, running an instance of **vim**.

Further calls to **tmux-vim** will open the files in new buffers in the same **vim** session.

If you close that **vim** session, the pane will be destroyed. The next call to **tmux-vim** will create a new one.

## Configuration

By default **tmux-vim** will create as many 80-column **vim** panes as possible, while leaving at least 132-columns for the shell session on the left.

This behaviour can be adjusted with the following environment variables.

### TMUX_VIM_ARGS

Command-line arguments to pass through to **vim**

### TMUX_VIM_PANE_WIDTH

Width of a single **vim** pane in columns (default 80)

### TMUX_VIM_PANES

Optionally specify a fixed number of **vim** panes with this

### TMUX_VIM_SHELL_MIN_WIDTH

If `TVIM_PANES` is not set, panes will be created to leave a shell pane of at least `TVIM_SHELL_MIN_WIDTH` columns.

On narrow displays, one **vim** pane will always be created, even if this means we leave less that `TVIM_SHELL_MIN_WIDTH` columns for the shell.

## How's it work?

**tmux** makes it all possible.

First `tmux split-window` is used to create the **vim** pane, and the pane id is saved in the tmux environment. This happens on demand - panes are created only when needed.

The **vim** instance is controlled by injecting keystrokes with `tmux send-keys`. To load a file, **tmux-vim** sends `:edit filename<cr>` to the **vim** instance.

Finally, `tmux select-pane` transfers control over to the **vim** pane.

## Bugs?

Probably.

By default, **vim** won't abandon an unsaved file to open another one, instead the user is prompted to save, abandon or cancel. This can throw out the keystroke injection when trying to open multiple files.

To avoid this problem, files are loaded with calls to `:badd` rather than `:edit`. After the last buffer is added, `:buffer` is used to switch to it. This delays the user prompt until the very end, when the user has regained control. This appears to work, but there may still be issues lurking.

When the **vim** pane is created, the current directory is saved in the **tmux** environment. The directory is used when computing relative paths. If the user manually changes the vim working directory, the relative paths will break.
